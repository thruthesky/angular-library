Angular Library

## Install

It's not a module. so, you need to install it by `git submodule add`.

If we build it as node module, it would be more easier to use. But we choose it to be as git submodule since it gives a greate convenient to develop and maintain.

```` sh
git submodule add https://github.com/thruthesky/angular-library src/app/modules/angular-library
````
